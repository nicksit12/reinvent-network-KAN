Our group is made up of three people, Alana, Nick, and Karla. 

For our banching/merging, we will have a designated main branch in which we will merge/commit changes as a group all in agreeement to prevent major issues with the code when merging and committing code. We will each have individual branches to work on before we can commit or merge any code onto the main branch, and we will also have individual branches for the different features we implement. We will also have a hot-fix branch in which we will merge everything before the main to ensure the code is working well together before we push it onto the main. This branch will allow us to catch any issues beforehand. 

We will have a directory in which we will store our coding artifacts and files, and another directory in which we will store our non-coding artifacts, which include the research we conduct. 

2 hrs of daily experimentation as a group 
3 hrs daily of research and coding individually 
1 hr daily of group research and coding 

Our communication mode will be via text and we will communicate via email with the professor. We will set a cut off for response times at 8:00pm. 

The mapping for the NIC ports, cable pin numbers, and GPIO pin numbers is located the csv file called 'Mappings'.
